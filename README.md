TF700t Android Kexecboot Installer Script

This installer script allows you to go through a kexecboot and
rootfs install. If this is your first install, follow the menu
choices in order. And although the scripts have some error
checking, be sure, as always, to make sure you have a current backup... 

This is a menu driven Android terminal based installer. 

You will need the following:

Prerequisites:

1- A working CROMi-X 5.4 w/ that10 or CROMBi-KK install
 on INTERNAL SD (no f2fs,data2fs or rom2sd)

2- A terminal emulator app (tested on Android Terminal Emulator)

3- Text editor (tested on Jota Editor - Not Jota+)

4- Script must be run from the extracted directory

5- Rootfs installer - USE ONLY ONE rootfs.tar.lzma file and
 it must be in installer directory

Running this script:

1- Open emulator and get root - su

2- cd to the directory you extracted this to

3- Run the script - sh AKBI.sh

4- Follow the prompts

Profit!
